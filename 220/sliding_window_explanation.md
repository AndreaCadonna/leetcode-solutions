# 🎯 Sliding Window + Ordered Structure: Complete Guide

**Master Guide for Proximity Problems with Efficient Range Queries**

---

## 🎯 Problem Understanding

### LeetCode Problem: Contains Duplicate III

**Given:** Integer array `nums`, integers `indexDiff` and `valueDiff`  
**Find:** If there exists pair of indices `(i, j)` such that:
- `i != j` (different indices)
- `abs(i - j) <= indexDiff` (close indices)  
- `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff` (close values)

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], indexDiff = 3, valueDiff = 0
Output: true
Explanation: Indices (0,3) satisfy all conditions
```

### Why This Problem is Tricky

- **Dual Constraints:** Both spatial (index) and value proximity required
- **Efficiency Challenge:** Naive O(n²) approach checks all pairs
- **Range Query Need:** For each element, find values within ±valueDiff range
- **Dynamic Data:** Elements enter and leave the search space as we progress

## 🔍 Why Sliding Window + Ordered Structure?

### The Core Insight

> **Key Realization:** Instead of checking all pairs, maintain a "sliding window" of elements within indexDiff distance, and use an ordered data structure to efficiently find values within valueDiff range.

### Strategy Breakdown

```
Sliding Window Approach:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Window of size ≤ indexDiff + 1            │
│  ┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐                     │
│  │ 2 │ 1 │ 4 │ 3 │ ? │ ← current element   │
│  └───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘                     │
│   ↑                                         │
│   oldest element (remove when window full)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

For current element, query: "Any value in [current ± valueDiff]?"
```

**Benefits:**
1. **Spatial Constraint:** Only elements within indexDiff are considered
2. **Efficient Range Query:** Ordered structure enables O(log k) value searches
3. **Dynamic Maintenance:** Add/remove elements as window slides

### Core Implementation

```python
class Solution(object):
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums, indexDiff, valueDiff):
        """
        Sliding window + ordered structure approach.
        
        Time: O(n log indexDiff), Space: O(indexDiff)
        """
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return False
            
        from sortedcontainers import SortedSet
        
        # Sliding window to maintain elements within indexDiff range
        window = SortedSet()
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # Remove elements outside window (too far)
            if i > indexDiff:
                window.remove(nums[i - indexDiff - 1])
            
            # Find the smallest element >= (num - valueDiff)
            pos = window.bisect_left(num - valueDiff)
            
            # Check if this element is within range [num - valueDiff, num + valueDiff]
            if pos < len(window) and window[pos] <= num + valueDiff:
                return True
            
            # Add current number to window for future iterations
            window.add(num)
        
        return False
```

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize:** Create empty SortedSet as sliding window
2. **For each element:**
   - Remove elements beyond indexDiff distance (maintain window)
   - Use binary search to find first candidate ≥ (current - valueDiff)
   - Check if candidate is ≤ (current + valueDiff)
   - If match found, return True
   - Add current element to window
3. **Return False** if no match found

## 📊 Complete Example Walkthrough

### Example: nums = [1,2,3,1], indexDiff = 3, valueDiff = 0

#### Step 1: Process index 0, num = 1
```
Remove elements beyond: 0 - 3 - 1 = -4 → None to remove
Current window (SortedSet): []
Range to check: [1 - 0, 1 + 0] = [1, 1]
Binary search: bisect_left(1) in [] → position 0
Check: No elements in window
Action: Add 1 to window
Result: window = [1]
```

#### Step 2: Process index 1, num = 2
```
Remove elements beyond: 1 - 3 - 1 = -3 → None to remove
Current window (SortedSet): [1]
Range to check: [2 - 0, 2 + 0] = [2, 2]
Binary search: bisect_left(2) in [1] → position 1
Check: No element at position 1
Action: Add 2 to window
Result: window = [1, 2]
```

#### Step 3: Process index 2, num = 3
```
Remove elements beyond: 2 - 3 - 1 = -2 → None to remove
Current window (SortedSet): [1, 2]
Range to check: [3 - 0, 3 + 0] = [3, 3]
Binary search: bisect_left(3) in [1, 2] → position 2
Check: No element at position 2
Action: Add 3 to window
Result: window = [1, 2, 3]
```

#### Step 4: Process index 3, num = 1 🎉
```
Remove elements beyond: 3 - 3 - 1 = -1 → None to remove
Current window (SortedSet): [1, 2, 3]
Range to check: [1 - 0, 1 + 0] = [1, 1]
Binary search: bisect_left(1) in [1, 2, 3] → position 0
Check: window[0] = 1, is 1 ≤ 1? YES! ✅
FOUND MATCH! Indices (0,3): abs(0-3)=3≤3, abs(1-1)=0≤0
Return True
```

## 🧮 Binary Search Deep Dive

### Range Query Logic

For current element `num`, we need to find any `x` in window such that:
```
abs(num - x) ≤ valueDiff
⟺ -valueDiff ≤ num - x ≤ valueDiff
⟺ num - valueDiff ≤ x ≤ num + valueDiff
⟺ x ∈ [num - valueDiff, num + valueDiff]
```

### Binary Search Strategy

```python
# Find first element >= (num - valueDiff)
pos = window.bisect_left(num - valueDiff)

# If this element exists and is <= (num + valueDiff), we have a match
if pos < len(window) and window[pos] <= num + valueDiff:
    return True
```

### Visual Example
```
Window: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Current: 6, valueDiff: 2
Search range: [6-2, 6+2] = [4, 8]

bisect_left(4) → position 1 (element 3 < 4, element 5 ≥ 4)
window[1] = 5, is 5 ≤ 8? YES! → Match found
```

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity | Explanation |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Window Maintenance** | O(log k) | Remove element from SortedSet |
| **Range Query** | O(log k) | Binary search in SortedSet |
| **Insert Element** | O(log k) | Add element to SortedSet |
| **Overall** | **O(n log k)** | n elements × O(log k) operations |

**Where k = min(indexDiff + 1, n)** (window size)

### Space Complexity: O(k)
- SortedSet stores at most indexDiff + 1 elements
- Additional O(1) for variables

### Why O(n log k) is Efficient
- **Better than brute force:** O(n²) → O(n log k)
- **k is bounded:** k ≤ indexDiff + 1, often much smaller than n
- **Logarithmic factor:** log k is small even for large windows

## 💡 Pro Tips & Tricks

### 💡 Pattern Recognition Signals
- **"Close indices" + "close values"** → Sliding Window + Ordered Structure
- **"Within distance/range"** → Consider range queries
- **"Find if exists"** → Early termination optimization
- **Large arrays with proximity constraints** → Avoid O(n²) approaches

### 💡 Implementation Mastery
- **Window size:** At most indexDiff + 1 elements
- **Remove timing:** When i > indexDiff, remove nums[i - indexDiff - 1]
- **Binary search usage:** bisect_left finds insertion point efficiently
- **Early return:** Stop as soon as valid pair is found

### 💡 SortedSet Operations
```python
# Key operations and their complexities:
window.add(x)           # O(log k) - insert maintaining order
window.remove(x)        # O(log k) - remove specific element
window.bisect_left(x)   # O(log k) - find insertion position
len(window)             # O(1) - get current size
window[i]               # O(1) - access by index
```

## 🧪 Additional Examples & Edge Cases

### Example 1: Larger Value Range
```python
Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], indexDiff = 2, valueDiff = 3
```

**Why returns False:**
```
Window size = 3 (indexDiff + 1)
Each position checks 3-element window for values within ±3 range
No valid pairs satisfy both index and value constraints
```

### Example 2: Mixed Positive/Negative
```python
Input: nums = [-1,0,1], indexDiff = 1, valueDiff = 1
```

**Trace:**
```
i=0, num=-1: window=[], add -1 → window=[-1]
i=1, num=0:  window=[-1]
  Range: [0-1, 0+1] = [-1, 1]
  bisect_left(-1) → position 0
  window[0] = -1, is -1 ≤ 1? YES! ✅
  Return True
```

### Example 3: Boundary Cases
- **Empty array:** Return False immediately
- **Single element:** Return False (need pairs)
- **valueDiff = 0:** Only exact matches qualify
- **Large indexDiff:** Window contains most/all elements

---

## 🔧 Optimization Techniques

### Early Termination Optimizations
```python
# Guard clauses for impossible cases
if len(nums) < 2 or indexDiff < 1 or valueDiff < 0:
    return False

# Special handling for exact matches
if valueDiff == 0:
    return self._handle_exact_matches(nums, indexDiff)
```

### Memory Optimizations
```python
# Alternative: Use bisect module with regular list (slower but less memory)
import bisect
window = []

# Insert: bisect.insort(window, num)  # O(k) due to list insertion
# Search: pos = bisect.bisect_left(window, target)
```

### Alternative Data Structures
- **Python:** `sortedcontainers.SortedSet` (recommended)
- **C++:** `std::multiset` or `std::set`
- **Java:** `TreeSet` (careful with duplicates)
- **Manual:** Maintain sorted list with binary search (slower)
